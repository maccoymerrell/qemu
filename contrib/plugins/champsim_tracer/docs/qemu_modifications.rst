QEMU base modifications
=======================

The ChampSim Tracer plugin is more than a self-contained ``.so``: it
relies on additions to QEMU's plugin API and on a handful of changes
to the TCG memory path so that the wrong-path simulator can mutate
guest registers and route guest stores through a per-vCPU speculative
buffer without corrupting the correct path.  This page enumerates
every patch we carry on top of upstream QEMU, why each is needed, and
where consumers should look for the matching code.

Plugin API additions
--------------------

``include/qemu/qemu-plugin.h`` (version bumped from 5 to 6)

   * ``qemu_plugin_insn_detail`` — Capstone-detail accessor that
     returns a structured ``qemu_plugin_insn_info`` for an
     in-flight ``qemu_plugin_insn`` (operands with type/access/size,
     implicit register reads/writes, instruction groups, x86
     prefix bits).  The plugin uses this in ``vcpu_tb_trans`` to
     classify each instruction without parsing disassembly strings.
   * ``qemu_plugin_cap_decode`` — same shape, but accepts a raw
     instruction byte buffer plus an explicit Capstone
     ``cs_arch`` / ``cs_mode`` pair.  Used for re-decoding the
     instructions of speculative basic blocks where we need the
     same Capstone view of bytes that the in-flight TCG translator
     wouldn't otherwise expose.
   * Bumped ``QEMU_PLUGIN_VERSION = 6`` to advertise the new entry
     points to plugin loaders.

``plugins/api.c`` and ``disas/disas-target.c``

   Glue.  ``qemu_plugin_insn_detail`` forwards to a new
   ``plugin_disas_detail()`` which delegates to
   ``cap_disas_plugin_detail()`` when Capstone is available for the
   target ISA, and falls back to the builtin disassembler with a
   ``mnemonic / op_str`` split otherwise (so RISC-V and MIPS still
   produce something the plugin's MNEM-table classifier can use).

``disas/capstone.c`` and ``include/disas/dis-asm.h``

   Two new entry points: ``cap_disas_plugin_detail`` (uses an
   in-flight ``disassemble_info`` and a known PC/size) and
   ``cap_disas_raw_detail`` (opens a fresh Capstone handle from
   ``cs_arch`` / ``cs_mode`` arguments).  Both fill the
   ``qemu_plugin_insn_info`` structure declared in
   ``qemu-plugin.h``.  The implementation maps Capstone's generic
   group enum to ``QEMU_PLUGIN_GRP_*`` bits, copies operand and
   register-name strings into the public buffers, and recovers x86
   ``LOCK`` / ``REP`` prefix flags from the Capstone detail block.

Speculative-execution support
-----------------------------

The wrong-path simulator drives QEMU's TCG to execute speculatively-
chosen translations whose architectural side effects must be
discarded at the end of each WP chain.  That requires three things
that stock TCG doesn't provide: faults during translation must
unwind cleanly, stores must route through a per-vCPU buffer instead
of touching guest memory, and translation faults must not deliver a
signal to the guest.  The hooks below cooperate with the plugin's
``cpu->plugin_spec_mode`` flag (added in the same plugin commit
series) to give the WP simulator a usable speculative path.

``accel/tcg/cpu-exec.c`` — ``cpu_plugin_exec_tb``

   The ``sigsetjmp(cpu->jmp_env, 0)`` guard now wraps both
   ``tb_lookup`` and ``tb_gen_code``, not just ``cpu_tb_exec``.
   Translating a TB during plugin speculative execution can fault
   (e.g. ``translator_ld()`` crossing into an unmapped page), and
   that path siglongjmps through ``cpu->jmp_env``.  Without the
   guard moved up, the longjmp would unwind past the plugin
   callback frame and deadlock on the next call.

``accel/tcg/cputlb.c`` and ``accel/tcg/user-exec.c`` —
``probe_access``

   When ``cpu_plugin_spec_active(env_cpu(env))`` is true, both
   probes return ``NULL`` so that callers fall back to the slow-
   path ``cpu_ld``/``cpu_st`` helpers.  Those helpers invoke the
   plugin's spec store buffer / load overlay; a successful direct
   host-pointer return would bypass the buffer and let speculative
   stores leak into guest memory.

``linux-user/signal.c`` — ``cpu_loop_exit_sigsegv`` /
``cpu_loop_exit_sigbus``

   When ``cpu->plugin_spec_mode`` is set, both helpers ``longjmp``
   out via ``cpu_loop_exit_restore()`` instead of queuing a guest
   signal via ``force_sig_fault()``.  A queued ``SIGSEGV`` would
   later be delivered on the correct path and kill the guest; the
   plugin observes the speculative fault via the ``tb_ok=false``
   return from ``cpu_plugin_exec_tb`` instead.

``target/arm/tcg/helper-a64.c``, ``target/i386/tcg/access.c``,
``target/ppc/mem_helper.c``

   Per-target store helpers (``DC ZVA``, x86 ``access_prepare_mmu``,
   PPC ``dcbz``).  These previously used a host fast-path memset
   when ``tlb_vaddr_to_host`` returned a usable pointer, bypassing
   the plugin's spec store buffer.  The patches drop the
   ``CONFIG_USER_ONLY`` gate around the ``cpu_st*`` slow path so
   that user-mode + speculative execution always routes through
   the buffer; non-speculative user-mode runs hit the slow path
   exactly when the host pointer is unavailable, the same as
   system mode.

Disassembly and target metadata
-------------------------------

``disas/capstone.c`` (the larger half of the diff)

   In addition to the plugin entry points above, this file gains a
   per-arch register-ID map.  Capstone's auto-generated
   ``getRegisterName()`` asserts on out-of-range IDs in
   ``CAPSTONE_DEBUG`` builds (the meson default).  We wrap each
   ``cs_reg_name()`` call with a per-arch upper bound (e.g.
   ``X86_REG_ENDING``) so the plugin can probe register IDs that
   appear in operand metadata without tripping the assert when
   Capstone exposes a sparse range.

``target/mips/cpu.c`` and ``configs/targets/mips*.mak`` plus
``gdb-xml/mips-cpu.xml`` / ``mips64-cpu.xml``

   Wires the MIPS GDB stub XML files into the build so the plugin's
   register-handle cache can resolve MIPS register names via
   ``qemu_plugin_get_registers()``.  Without these the cache returns
   empty for MIPS targets and ``regdata=1`` traces would have no
   register snapshots.

``target/riscv/cpu.h``

   Inserts the ``end_reset_fields`` marker into ``CPUArchState`` so
   ``cpu_reset()`` clears the right region.  Required for
   ``regdata=1`` on RISC-V where the previous boundary left the
   plugin's snapshot scratch in undefined state across reset.

``include/elf.h``

   Adds the generic build-attributes section type
   ``SHT_ARM_ATTRIBUTES`` / ``SHT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES`` and matching
   ``Tag_*`` enumerations, used by the ISA-mode resolvers in
   ``champsim_tracer_isa.cc`` to detect RVC, RVV, and TSO from the
   guest ELF rather than guessing.

``linux-user/plugin-api.c``

   One-line: pulls in ``loader.h`` so the plugin can call
   ``qemu_plugin_path_to_binary()`` from ``vcpu_init_cb`` to find
   the guest ELF for the build-attributes parse.

Build wiring
------------

``contrib/plugins/meson.build``

   Adds the C++ language requirement and lists every
   ``champsim_tracer/*.cc`` source so that meson builds the plugin
   as a single ``.so`` with the right Capstone dependency.  Also
   handles the Windows shared-module form by linking against the
   import library.

``meson.build`` and ``linux-user/meson.build``

   Threads the plugin sources through the top-level project so
   ``ninja contrib/plugins/libchampsim_tracer.so`` is enough to
   build the plugin from a configured QEMU build directory.
